BSC WORST:
	Sample ID 1577:
		This sample has an error 78.77 meters in the BSC algorithm, it choose the 1533 sample as the ideal trainning sample, and it has a feature distance of 9.85. It only has 1 detected AP, with a value of -86 

		Plain KNN has the same results as BSC.

		SAS brought the error down to 2.96 meters, wich is an incredible drop in terms of error, it used the sample 201 as training and has a feature distance of 12.04

		Conclusion:
			SAS identified correctly the cluster this sample belongs to, while  BSC also identified the cluster with the sample 201, it has a sample that has less feature distance, but more geometric distance.

			In this case the problem comes from treating the undetected values as regular ones in the KNN.



	Sample ID 3662:
		In BSC this sample has an error of 76.21 meters, it used the sample 1533 has its training sample, same as sample 1577, with a feature distance of 6.40 and only one detected AP with the value of -90.

		Plain KNN has the same result as BSC.

		SAS also failed to provide decent results only dcreasing the error to 50.94 meters, it used the sample 618 as training sample, with a feature distance of 48.38.

		Conclusion:
			SAS and BSC both failed here, either due to cluster misidentification, or the KNN using the wrong samples as closet due to the undetected values.

			After creating a script to check the closest samples geometracly, and their info we can say that SAS failed to identifiy the most suitable cluster, since none of the 5 closest geometrical samples belong to cluster selected, also 3 of the geometrical closest one have a lower fea. distance than the one selected by SAS.

			For BSC the correct cluster was identified, since the closest geometrical samples all belong to them, but there are samples with a lower feature distance. BSC fails in the KNN phase due to undetected values being treated as normal.


	Sample ID 539:
		In BSC this sample has an error of 74.95, it used smple 1533 (again) has the training sample, with a feature distance of 31.37, the sample has 2 detected APs both with a value of -73.


		Plain KNN has the same results as BSC.

		SAS bring this error down to 4.19 meters, using the sample 635 with a feature distance of 35.01.


		Conclusion:
			SAS identifeid correctly the cluster this sample belongs to, while  BSC also identified the cluster with the sample 635, it has a sample that has less feature distance, but more geometric distance.

			In this case the problem comes from treating the undetected values as regular ones in the KNN.


PLAIN WORST:
	Same as BSC


SAS WORST:
	
	Sample 3662, same as BSC and Plain

	Sample ID 3747:
		SAS This sample has an error of 57.37 meters, it choosed the sample 533 has ideal with a feature distance of 52.81, this sample has 10 detected APs ['-86','-78','-78','-78','-76','-76','-84', '-85','-82','-84']


		Plain KNN has an error of 24.51 meters, using sample 2530 (3 detected APs), with a feature distance of 45.

		BSC has a drop in error to 2.30, using sample 450 (16 detected APs), with a feature distance of 53.96


		Conclusion:
			BSC identifeid correctly the cluster this sample belongs to, while SAS also identified the cluster with the smaple 450, it has a sample that has less feature distance, but more geometric distance.

			In this case the problem comes from treating the undetected values as regular ones in the KNN.


	Sample ID 6805:
		In SAS this sample has an error of 44.81, selecting the sample 2932 with a feature distance of 30.39, the sample has 13 detected APs ['-90', '-89', '-82', '-83', '-82', '-81', '-82', '-85', '-84', '-84', '-84', '-85', '-75']

		PLain KNN has the same result as SAS.

		BSC also has the same result as SAS.

		Conclusion:
			SAS and BSC both failed here, either due to cluster misidentification, or the KNN using the wrong samples as closet due to the undetected values.

			In this case the 5 geometricaly closest sample belong to the cluster selected by SAS, but they have a bigger feat. distance, the problem is due to the udetected treatment in the KNN stage.

			For BSC its the same.




Training Sample ID 1533:
	Only one detected AP with a value of -91


BSC improvements:
	BSC uses undetected APS to choose clusters, creating a rule to not allow this might help mitigating this large errors.
